>**Note**: Please **fork** the current Udacity repository so that you will have a **remote** repository in **your** Github account. Clone the remote repository to your local machine. Later, as a part of the project "Post your Work on Github", you will push your proposed changes to the remote repository in your Github account.

### Project Title
Post your project on Github

### Description
In this project, you will create a GitHub repository and your local repository. You will work on a repo for your BikeShare project, making multiple branches, making edits to files on those branches (e.g., a readme file and your Python code), and then you will commit the changes to your remote repository.

### Files used
Bikeshare.py

### Credits
Udacity Platform has made us understand the core concepts of data science very well.
Especially the concepts including python.

The next branch you'll be working on will be refactoring. Here, you can modify your bikeshare.py file to make improvements to the efficiency or readability of your code. You'll practice committing your code as you work on it, with at least three commits on this branch with meaningful messages. Notice that this branch touches the code in your bikeshare.py file, while the documentation branch touches the docstrings in your file. This means you can work on these branches simultaneously without any conflicts! This is a common practice in the real world.

Refactoring is the goal of cleaning the code to make it leaner and more efficient, and to overall improve the design of the code without impacting the external functionality of the code.
